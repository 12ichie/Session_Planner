# Session_Planner

Overview 

A web page for building a workout session. This includes multiple lists for exercises, repetitions/time and days of the week. Other features include a timer and the use of local storage to store information put into the table. The web page was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Note 

My inspiration for making this project came from one of my previous roles, being a personal trainer, and I wanted to create a small application to gain front-end web development experience as well as to show my creativity in designing a web page.
